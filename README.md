# ai-training-data-txt-export
A Python utility that can take a bunch of files and output them into a single training file as .txt for using with LLMs.

This script is designed to work in a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) that you create.

Instructions:
- Paste the Python script from [convert-data-to-text.py](https://github.com/mattsilv/ai-training-data-txt-export/blob/main/convert-data-to-text.py) into a blank Google Colab notebook.
- Select the menu at top, Runtime > "Run All".
- See the choose file and upload box appear below the script (Screenshot below).
- Upload your input file (supports only xlsx and zip right now), and the script will join all the file contents and output structured data in a .txt file.
